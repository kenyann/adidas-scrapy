The addition of the Clip-In model takes the range to the next level, making our award-winning design available to clip-in pedal users for the first time.\n\nThe Trailcross range was built from the ground up, starting with the Five Ten dotted outsole with the addition of a recessed cleat to clip into compatible pedals. This was then refined with hiking in mind, bringing the additional ridged grip to the toe and heel. The Trailcross Clip-In is a lightweight and breathable shoe. With the need for the shoe to provide all-day comfort but also deliver across the contact points on and off the bike, the mid-sole EVA technology provides the necessary toe flex for hiking, without losing the all-important stiffness. The Trailcross Clip-In utilizes a hook and loop closure for added security and to reduce heel lift. Clip-in pedal users no longer need to compromise when planning their next adventure.", "review_count": [" 3"], "avg_rating": ["3.3"], "scraped_at": "2023-12-13 21:24:06", "color": "Burgundy / Orbit Green F21 / Turbo", "brand": "Adidas", "currency": "USD", "url": "https://www.adidas.com/us/five-ten-trailcross-clip-in-mountain-bike-shoes/GZ9842.html", "availability": "INSTOCK", "images": ["https://assets.adidas.com/images/w_600,f_auto,q_auto/63fb37993c4740baaf98ad8700810e79_9366/Five_Ten_Trailcross_Clip-In_Mountain_Bike_Shoes_Burgundy_GZ9842_01_standard.jpg", "https://videos.adidas.com/videos/w_600,f_auto,q_auto/b20bb2f581a64888a976ae54010cd534_d98c/Five_Ten_Trailcross_Clip-In_Mountain_Bike_Shoes_Burgundy_GZ9842_video.jpg", "https://assets.adidas.com/images/w_600,f_auto,q_auto/f0faed14c4a844c6b91eae5801382827_9366/Five_Ten_Trailcross_Clip-In_Mountain_Bike_Shoes_Burgundy_GZ9842_010_standard.jpg", "https://assets.adidas.com/images/w_600,f_auto,q_auto/8b7038fee0284175b37ead8700811cf7_9366/Five_Ten_Trailcross_Clip-In_Mountain_Bike_Shoes_Burgundy_GZ9842_02_standard.jpg"]}
